Calibrating Gyrochronology using Kepler Asteroseismic targets

This is where I'll attempt to use rotation periods measured in K-ACF, as well as the asteroseismically determined ages and masses for the 505 stars in Chaplin et al, 2013 to calibrate the existing Gyrochronology relations of Barnes (2007) and(?) Mamajek and Hillenbrand (2008).
